# Learn Solidity for Ethereum
This is a sample course curriculum for teaching developers Solidity programming on the Ethereum blockchain. Each module will teach important concepts and theory followed by hands on Labs that applies the knowledge in a self contained exercise. Some of the bullet points can definitely be expanded into more sub-sections (e.g. Smart Contract in Module 1) but for sake of brevity are kept concise. Some modules contains "Case Studies" that will dive into the code of existing projects and extract out important lessons and insights to keep in mind when programming for Ethereum.
